# RebuildSheetMusicWeb

<<This is a practice project for Vanilla JavaScript.>>

In this project, I rebuild of the Mutopia website, incorporating my understanding of UX. This is just a personal practice project. For the main website, please visit 'https://www.mutopiaproject.org/contribute.html'. If the operators of Mutopia like my design, you can freely use it.

On the main page of the website, I used an older method to implement the navigation bar functionality. On the subsequent pages, I used the new JS syntax. 

On the final page(sheetMusicPage), you can comment out the Local section and uncomment the Server section. Then, you can open a terminal, navigate to the mockApi folder, and run the server using the command <node sheetMusicServer.js>.
