# RebuildSheetMusicWeb
This is a rebuild of the Mutopia website, incorporating my understanding of UX. 

This is just a personal practice project. For the main website, please visit 'https://www.mutopiaproject.org/contribute.html'. If the operators of Mutopia like my design, you can freely use it.

On the main page of the website, I used an older method to implement the navigation bar functionality. On the subsequent pages, I used the new JS syntax.
